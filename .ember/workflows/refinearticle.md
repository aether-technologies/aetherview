## Goal
Refine, modify, update, or tweak an article based on feedback from the user.

## Process
Download the article from NextCloud.
Plan out the changes to be made.
Conduct any additional research if needed.
Update the article locally.
Upload the updated article to NextCloud.

## Rules
 * Drafts should be in markdown format.
 * Use a professional and friendly tone in the article.
 * Use a clear and concise writing style. Keep the article to between 1200 and 1500 words.
 * Use proper grammar and spelling.
 * Only use numbers and exact measurements when a source provides them.
 * Be sure to include links to the sources of information in the drafts.  These will generally be provided by Perplexity and ChatGPT.
 * Consider SEO and keywords when drafting the title, meta description and article content.
 * Store drafts in NextCloud in the 'AetherView/articles/drafts' directory.  Use the NextCloud MCP server to access and manage them.
 * Store any local drafts in '.ember/articles/drafts'.
 * If you need more information for the paper, then use DuckDuckGo or Brave to search the web.
 * If you are unsure about anything in Perplexity's or ChatGPT's drafts, then fact check the links they provide using BrowserMCP.
 * If you experience a timeout with BrowserMCP at any point, then just reconnect and check the current page.  Often, Perplexity and ChatGPT will continue to work while BrowserMCP times out.
 * DO NOT modify or delete any files on this computer or via MCP servers other than those specified in the process.

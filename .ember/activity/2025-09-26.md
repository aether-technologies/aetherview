## AetherView Article Listing Implementation

### Summary
Implemented a JSON-based article listing system for AetherView to dynamically populate "Top Articles", "Latest Articles" sections and enable search functionality.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Created a structured `articles.json` file with sample article data matching the existing site's articles
2. Developed a central JavaScript module (`articles.js`) to handle loading and filtering article data
3. Updated home page to dynamically display featured and latest articles
4. Enhanced the articles page to load and display articles from the JSON file
5. Implemented search functionality that works across all articles
6. Created test script to verify JSON implementation
7. Documented the implementation for future reference

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding pagination for larger article collections
- Implement more advanced filtering by categories and tags
- Add a content management interface for editing the JSON file

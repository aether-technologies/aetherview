## Nextcloud CRUD Workflows Creation

Created n8n workflows for Nextcloud file operations with complete CRUD functionality:

- Created **List Files** workflow (ID: q3kQyEb23M9Zuphe) that supports searching files in specific directories
- Created **Create File** workflow (ID: RK9yA3MFx4KCCfwG) for uploading both text and binary files
- Created **Read File** workflow (ID: FHmUevIIvWSLDwEr) for downloading files with options for text or binary output
- Created **Update File** workflow (ID: uJ6mCfLL7kkZXI2Q) that validates file existence before updating
- Created **Delete File** workflow (ID: k0Anaos0HWxoYZmn) with file existence verification

Also produced:
- Comprehensive documentation at `docs/cascade-notes/2025-09-18-nextcloud-workflows.md`
- Test script at `scripts/test_nextcloud_workflows.sh` for validating all operations

All workflows are configured as webhooks that can be integrated with the existing AetherView infrastructure and accessed via REST API calls.

Next steps would include:
- Activating workflows in n8n
- Configuring Nextcloud credentials
- Testing workflows with the provided script
- Adding authentication to secure the endpoints

# Task: Sync articles.json with www/articles/

- Date: 2025-09-29
- Stage: Coding
- Summary: Updated `www/data/articles.json` to reflect the three actual articles in `www/articles/`.
- Details:
  - Parsed metadata from article HTML files:
    - `ai-social-intelligence-metaverse-npcs.html`
    - `apple-vision-pro-immersive-films.html`
    - `metaverse-evolution.html`
  - Extracted title, date, author, authorTitle, category, and used `<meta name="description">` as excerpt where available.
  - Set `imageUrl` and `thumbnailUrl` to existing placeholders in `www/images/placeholders/` to avoid broken links.
  - Kept `featured` and `trending` false for consistency until explicitly curated.

- Next Steps:
  - Replace placeholder images with real assets when available.
  - Decide which posts should be `featured`/`trending` on the homepage.
